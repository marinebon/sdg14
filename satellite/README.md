You can drop files (*.R, *.Rmd, *.csv, *.txt, *.tif, *.ncdf etc), but there is a 100 MB per file limit and 1 GB per entire repository.

You're discouraged therefore from making this the major data storage for large rasters.
Instead, we can come up with another place, ie on the server, and use this to store scripts and documentation.
